## MileStone2 (4/19)
In milestone2, we focus on collecting and analysising data. We release four tools:

* data_crawling: Crawl data from Facebook chatroom log & DCard website.
* tf-idf: Tf-idf analysis to extract keywords from each chatroom for further analysis.
* visual_LM: Building language model for each chatroom and try to do some analysis (including nearest neighbor search, multidimensional scaling analysis).
* word2vec: Using neural network non-linear model to embed each word into a meaningful vector space for further analysis.

Go to `Data_analysis/` for more detailed description for each module.
